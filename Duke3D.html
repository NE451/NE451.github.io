      <h2>3D Realms - 1996 - PC</h2> <br>
    
      <div class="linediv"></div>
    <p><i>"Hail to the King, Baby!"</i> Such an iconic quote from one of the greatest FPS we witnessed in the 90's. Duke Nukem 3D is the third game from the saga made by Apogee Software and probably not a lot of people played the original two games (which were action platformers) compared to Duke3D.</p>
<p>For this review I'm playing with the Atomic Edition (not gonna buy or even remotely touch the World Tour) and I will be covering only the original three episodes.
    I plan on reviewing Duke It Out in D.C / Duke's Caribbean: Life's A Beach / Duke's Nuclear Winter tho since I really loved the base game and I hope the expansions will add something new to spice it up.
   </p>
   <div class="linediv"></div> 
   <p>The plot (yes, there is actually one) starts off from Duke2: Duke is returning to Earth in his Space Cruiser and he gets shot down. He quickly escapes his pod and descends into Los Angeles, thus starting the first episode "L.A Meltdown". </p>

  </div>

<p>I really love this episode! Right from the start you are catapulted into action, dropping into a vent and you get into a softcore theatre fighting off LAPD Pigs, flying anthropomorphic aliens and some levels later you will encounter flying dinosaur-like aliens and octopus monsters with psychic powers, all with Duke saying lots of one liners that are pretty outdated nowadays.</p>

  <div class="container"><span class="sourcesansprocontainer">Those alien cops needs a good ass kicking with the shotgun.</span> </div>
  </div>

<p>See, Duke was a very ironic game for that time with gore, profanity (which was weird for the time) and softcore elements. I sometimes like it such as the banter while killing aliens, but sometimes the masculinity of Duke feels forced and dated. The cool thing tho is that if you kill the babes the game spawns more enemies and I liked that, as he would say "Duke loves all the babes in the world".</p>

    <div class="container"><span class="sourcesansprocontainer">"That's one doomed marine" Nice jab, 3D Realms.</span> </div>
    </div>
 
<p>The only level I didn't liked of the first episode was The Abyss, it felt so big but without a clear indication on what to do, I had to use a walkthrough just to discover I was pretty close to the end of the level. </p>    
<p>Best one tho is Death Row, tied with Hollywood Holocaust. Those were great levels and I liked the variations on "find key, open door, go to next locked door" so it doesen't feel stale.
    About the final boss of the episode: the Battlelord is cool and you can circle him pretty easily, it's a good test if you mastered the movement quirks of this game.</p>
<p>Duke3D is a VERY fast paced game, you will run very fast while continously swapping weapons to deal with every enemy. Soon enough strafing and crouching will become your best friends.
</p>

    <div class="container"><span class="sourcesansprocontainer">The Battlelord has a hitscan chaingun cannon and it shoots way faster than yours so don't try to fight him like a classic shooter, just circle strafe him.</span> </div>
    </div>

    <div class="linediv"></div>

<p>The second episode is called Lunar Apocalypse and starts off with Duke going into space to end the alien invasion. I really liked this episode, there was a good variety of levels, startin from a Spaceport, an Incubator chock full of alien eggs, a Fusion Station and a very funny easter egg in the Lunar Reactor level starring (what remains of) Luke Skywalker.</p>

<div class="image">
    <img src="images/Duke3D/Duke5.jpg" style="width:100%"> 
    <div class="container"><span class="sourcesansprocontainer">“Now this is a force to be reckoned with”</span> </div>
    </div>
<p>The last level "Overlord" is definitely the weakest of the bunch and the boss room has so much space to manuver him and circle strafe him just like the Battlelord.</p>

<div class="image">
    <img src="images/Duke3D/Duke6.jpg" style="width:100%"> 
    <div class="container"><span class="sourcesansprocontainer">The Devastator is your best friend, you can easily melt him in seconds.</span> </div>
    </div>

    <div class="linediv"></div>
<p>The third episode is called Shrapnel City and you're again in LA to fight the Cycloid Emperor, leader of the alien menace.
    This episode is a mixed bag. The three first levels are off to a great start and there is some level variety from a lounge bar, a bank with a very good puzzle to access the caveau and a flooded zone chuck full of stronger enemies such as the Assault Commander (a large alien in a hovering veichle), Enforcers (those dinosaur like)
    and lots, lots of Battlelord Sentry identical to the first boss and deadly in short rooms.</p>
<p>And then there are levels such as Movie Set and Hotel Hell, those levels in the difficulty I've played (Come Get Some) are brutal, especially if you don't have enough ammo for the devastator to deal with the Battlelord Sentry, they feel really cheap just to let you restart over and over again until you can cheap them out by trapping into corners and shooting rockets from weird angles where they can't shoot back.</p>
<p>The final boss is nothing outstanding, the real difficulty are the weaker enemies that will constantly shoot at you and they can easily deplete your health.</p>

<div class="image">
    <img src="images/Duke3D/Duke7.jpg" style="width:100%"> 
    <div class="container"><span class="sourcesansprocontainer">Same strategy as the other two, just conserve as much Devastator and RPG ammo and dodge his missiles while circle strafing.</span> </div>
    </div>

    <div class="linediv"></div>
<p>Now that levels are over, we can talk about the arsenal of Duke3D, the real star of the videogame.</p>
<p>The basic pistol is cool, nothing outstanding. I have seen better pistols in videogaming such as the M1911 in COD:BO, the M6D in Halo or the PPK in Goldeneye 007 and I would say this pistol feels like the USP in Half Life 2, a light weight low power gun that is good for clearing out weaker enemies and destroy surroundings.</p>
<p>I really like how many secrets are accessible by blowing up specific pieces and you can do it in various ways (RPG, the Pipebomb, shooting gas canisters) and the reward are ranging from not so useful in lower difficulties and very helpful in Come Get Some (Hard) difficulty.</p>
<p>The shotgun feels weak at first but becomes better and better if you use it at extremely close range. I think ammo is a bit too scarce in harder difficulties and that makes up for the great stopping power it has.
</p>
<p>The SMG of this game is called the Chaingun Cannon and shoots extremely fast and can stunlock enemies, you will definitely use it a lot with weaker enemies and it's great for crowd control. Ammo is very common but I didn't use it as much as the shotgun, the pistol or the RPG.</p>
<p>The RPG is a stellar weapon, with a single rocket you can deal great damage, clear our easily every enemy and while ammo is uncommon you are greatly rewarded if you can hit precise shots. The Devastator is only good for bosses and Battlelords, it feels it has way less damage than the RPG or even the pipebomb.</p>

<div class="image">
    <img src="images/Duke3D/Duke8.jpg" style="width:100%"> 
    <div class="container"><span class="sourcesansprocontainer">Not so scary anymore, huh?</span> </div>
    </div>
<p>And there is the best weapon of this game: the Shrinker. If the enemy is low enough, the Shrinker will reduce it to a 1/10 of his size and Duke will squish it out with his “mighty foot” making a very satisfing squish sound. This is the best weapon to deal with the Assault Commander, you can make short work of them and squish them all in a couple of seconds. On the same slot there is the Expander that makes enemies inflate and explode like baloons, but I didn't try it enough to say that it's great or not.</p>
<p>I used like once the trip mine and blow myself up just like I do in Half Life so I don't even bother trying them. The Freezethrower is cool for weaker enemies but you're definitely better with shooting them with the Pistol or the Chaingun Cannon.</p>
<p>Duke has a cool arsenal of gadgets and like Blood you can use them when you want. The Adrenaline gives you insane speed (and Duke is already a fast game itself), the medkit is very useful in tight situations and the jetpack lets you break entire levels by just flying to key spots. Holo-Duke was worthless in the hardest difficulty and I never had to use the night vision goggles.</p>

<div class="linediv"></div>

<p>The sound of this game is stellar, even if all sounds are heavily compressed (just like HL) they feel good especially the sounds of  the Shotgun / RPG / Shrinker. The enemies sound design is very good and doesen't feel as stale even when you arrive to the lastest levels having murdered countless copies of those enemies,you will still love hearing them crying when you blow them up or gib them with the shotgun.</p>
<p>The Soundtrack is amazing and I can't just explain it other than saying it's iconic and it should be listened by anyone who likes rock melodies in gaming. Lee Jackson did a stellar job and if you listened to the OST of Rise of the Triad you will easily recognize his superb talent in making iconic soundtracks. I really, really reccomend you to listen to both of those OST, you won't regret it.</p>

<div class="linediv"></div>

<p>Overall I really, really loved this game, it felt like a technical leap from Doom and how Ken Silverman made a great engine when used by talented developers such as 3D Realms.
    I really recommend it.</p>
