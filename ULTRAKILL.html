          <p>So I've been watching in those weeks some videos by the youtuber Civvie11 (which I really really recommend) and I decided to jump in this period of reinassance of the boomer shooter genre and here we are with the demo of this awesome game. </p>
          <p>This game is made by Arsi "Hakita" Patala aand published by New Blood Interactive. This developer is really mad talented and as soon as you open the game you understand why.</p>

        </div>
          
        <p>After a really cool intro that gives you the basics of the gameplay you're getting straight into action as soon as you get your first gun. There is heavy emphasis on killing enemies with style and jumping and zooming across the rooms while blasting enemies with a good arsenal for a demo: a pistol that can pierce enemies, a shotgun that can be supercharged to explode like a bomb and a chaingun cannon that shoots incredibly fast.</p>
        <p>The gunplay feels very very good and compliments the fast paced nature of the game, the basic pistol is pretty op if you can reliably do multiple headshots in a row. At the end of every mission you get some points you can spend into weapons: you can unlock a second pistol with a coin, if you shoot the coin at the right time you deal critical damage to one enemy. The shotgun can be pumped but if you overheat it will explode and instakill you. I don't know if there is a chaingun upgrade, I have to unlock all the secrets and see if there is more as I have a strong feeling there are so many things I have missed.</p>
        <p>The score system rocks hard, you can chain multiple things and you're rewarded to tinker with your skills and weapons to keep the score as high as you can, as everything at the end of the level counts for your final rank: enemies killed, style score, time and how many retries and secrets you have found.</p>

         <p>There are 6 levels in this demo: one Prelude act with 5 levels and the first level of the first ACT. 
            In 90mins I cleared all the demo had to offer with a pretty crappy score, B but I think I'll replay it again in Hard Mode just to get my slow reaction skills get even worse when the game gets nasty fast.</p>   
        <p>I loved how the game goes from a red-ish palette for the prelude act to something much different in the Limbo, but see for yourself:</p>

                <div class="linediv"></div>        
        <p>The soundtrack is AMAZING, there are some really good Drum n' Bass bangers and they will hype you a lot, especially when you unload a fully pumped shotgun into an hall while you run at sonic speeds, bathing in their blood. </p>
        <p>This game doesen't care about getting super violent to the point it's comedic and the music really compliments this amazing feeling.</p>

            </div>

      
      <p> Last thing I wanna talk about are the bosses: I have encountered three bosses and the last one is super dope: a giant stone guardian with some nasty but telegraphed attacks and there isn't much space to manuver around until you learn his patterns, then becomes a piece of cake... until you deplete half of his health. Then another guardian spawns and the battle becomes really intense and you have to master dashing and jumping on walls to even think to survive this, yet alone get a really good score.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="linediv"></div>   

        <p>I don't wanna spoil everything, for 90mins of a demo I really wanna see how much of this game is hidden under the surface. Right now Ultrakill is in early access and it's worth every penny.
            Bravo Hakita Dev!</p>
