    <p>So I've been playing IMSCARED.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure everyone remember that time when indie horror games filled to the brim with cheap jumpscares were pretty popular. IMSCARED managed to stand up in this horde as a very creative title with a simple premise: a pretty criptic and "short pixelated nightmare" as the developer says.</p>
<p>Originally released in 2012 on GameJolt (a famous site for indie videogame developers), this Steam version released in 2016 and it's considered the definitive version, greatly expanding the original game, adding some achievements and multiple endings.</p>
<div class="linediv"></div>

<p>Graphically speaking the game has a very, very particular aesthetic: big pixelated textures and some dithering resembling the graphics of early horror games of 90s.</p>

<div class="image">
  <img src="images/IMSCARED/screen2.png" style="width:100%">
  <div class="container"> <span class="sourcesansprocontainer">It's amazing how low poly graphics can still convey dark, bloody atmospheres.</span></div>
  </div>
  
<p>The story is experienced thru some in game text and a large amount of criptic images, this reminded me the first Silent Hill and it nailes it perfectly. Even it's pretty simplicistic, it works.
    The "main villain" makes its introduction a couple of scenes into the game, making it crash altogheter. That's where the magic begins: IMSCARED creates a folder in your desktop and creates various text files, this mechanic flows well with all the puzzles you do and never feels obtuse or downright unfair.</p>

<p>I didn't really liked the achievement system. I get that having no information at all makes the player puzzled at all the things he sees, but the secret ending requires a 100% completition and a guide can provide you the steps needed, but I would have loved to see a bit more tips in game.</p>

<div class="image">
    <img src="images/IMSCARED/screen3.png" style="width:100%">
    <div class="container"> <span class="sourcesansprocontainer">The game likes to change the main menu, a lot. The more you will play, the more it will become familiar and useful.</span></div>
    </div>

<p>The gameplay it's mostly based on walking between rooms and doing puzzles while uncovering its secret. It doesen't drag for too long, a couple of hours and you will finish it, short and sweet.</p>

<div class="image">

    <div class="container"> <span class="sourcesansprocontainer">The monster design is downright unsettling.</span></div>
    </div>

<p>I loved the sound design! Listen for youself, this is comparable to the masterful ambient sounds made by Yamaoka we all loved in SH games and I'm not exaggerating.</p>

<p>The game is currently 3.99â‚¬ on Steam and it's worth every damn penny. 
    Definitely check it out for a short yet sweet ride.</p>
