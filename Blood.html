        <br>

        <p> I live, again... How fitting for this re-release of one of the "holy trinity" of games made with Build Engine: Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior and Blood.

            Running on the KEX Engine by the talented developer Samuel Villarreal the game shines with a 60fps constant framerate and DX11 / OpenGL and even a Vulkan renderer. The only downside about the DX render is that you cannot use the overlay or take screenshots unless you run the game in windowed or borderless mode. Not a huge deal but still annoying.</p>

        <p>I admit I spent quite some times looking at all those amazing rooms rendered in DX11.</p>
      </div>
      </div>

        <p>The plot is barebone like every other fps before the arrival of the two colossus that began the narrative shooter genre: Half-Life & Unreal.
            The story begins with the protagonist and cultist Caleb getting killed with his friends by the dark god T'chernobog. After he discovers to be still alive, Caleb decides to get revenge by mass murdering everything he sees . Talk about having a wicked sense of justice.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The game is divided into 4 chapters plus two expansions called Plasma Pak and Cryptic Passage which are both selectable from the main menu.
            The first chapter is arguably the most difficult one: you will learn how to chuck barrels of dynamite (which takes a bit of time), to use ammo properly, since you will experience shortages in the first levels. </p>

              <p>Meet your new friend, the dynamite bundle!</p>
              </div>
            </div>

        <p> Every fight feels like a little puzzle with multiple ways to solve it, from going guns blazing to abuse the unique weakness of every enemy.</p>

                <div class="container">
                  <p>One of the best feeling you can get: a room full of cultist and a loaded shotgun ready to blast some holes.</p>
                </div>
              </div>

        <p> The main chapters feels very diverse one to the another in both terms of enemy variety, ammo count and backgrounds.
            Caleb goes in the first chapter from his grave to a chapel then he finds himself in a train station fighting his way to the last train. After delibertly derailing it he visits a Luna Park and in the end he reaches the boss: a giant Stone Gargoyle related to her lover Ophelia. </p>

                    <div class="container">
                      <p>This is the best time to introduce him to your new toy: the Napalm Launcher!</p>
                    </div>
                  </div>

        <p>The two expansions feel very different from the main game: while Plasma Pak was built in house by Monolith, Cryptic Passage was not.
            I really didn't like Cryptic Passage: while it had huge environments to explore, it felt really empty and boring, without that distinct feel of actually doing something than just finding keys and blowing up cultists.
            The final boss was just terrible, a quick rip off by picking the Cerberus boss in chapter 3 and doubling it in a very small area. Just a bad design overall.</p>

                        <p>I just fought a couple of zombies here. So much free space wasted...</p>
                    </div> 
                  </div>

        <p>Plasma Pak felt like a palette cleanser after Cryptic Passage: it picks up after the end of the main game and introduces new alt-fires for some weapons such as the Napalm Launcher and new type of enemies like the Mini Calebs .</p>

                          <p>Those small clones are perky bastards, if you've got a spare dynamite blow 'em up for good.</p>  
                      </div>  
                    </div>     
                     
        <p>The boss fight was just amazing! Three cultist that once received enough damage they trasform into the real boss called The Beauty and the Beasts.

            It was really fun to do all the achievements, in the end I took a total of 30hrs to finish it 100% on the Well Done difficulty, which is hard as nails.

            Really, really recommended to pick up for dirt cheap on a Steam discount, definitely worth the price. 9/10</p>
