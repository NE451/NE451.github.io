      <h1>Blood: Fresh Supply </h1>
        <h2>Monolith Productions - 1997 - PC <br> Nightdive Studious - 2019 - PC </h2>

        <p> <i> I live, again... </i> How fitting for this re-release of one of the "holy trinity" of games made with Build Engine: Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior and Blood. </p>
      <p>Blood has a long running history of having a lot of ports and lot of confusion since the source code was never released: fan made ports are based on multiple solutions such as BloodGDX (Java framework), NBLood (EDuke32) and finally Fresh Supply (reverse engineering).</p>
      <p> Running on the KEX Engine by the talented developer Samuel Villarreal the game shines with 60fps and three graphical renders: DX11 / OpenGL / Vulkan. <br> The only downside about the DX render is that you cannot use the overlay or take screenshots unless you run the game in windowed or borderless mode. Not a huge deal but still annoying.</p>

        I spent quite some time looking at all those amazing rooms rendered in DX11. </span>
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="linediv"></div> 
      <p>The plot is barebone like every other fps of that era before the arrival of the two colossus that began the narrative shooter genre: Half-Life & Unreal. <br>
            The story begins with the protagonist and cultist Caleb getting killed with his friends by the dark god T'chernobog. After he discovers to be still alive, Caleb decides to get revenge by mass murdering everything he sees. &nbsp; Talk about having <i>a wicked sense of justice, huh.</i> </p>
      
        <p>The game is divided into 4 chapters plus two expansions called Plasma Pak and Cryptic Passage which are both selectable from the main menu.
            The first chapter is arguably the most difficult one: you will learn how to chuck barrels of dynamite (which takes a bit of time) and to use ammo properly since you will experience shortages in the first levels. This does become less noticeable once you reach the circus halfway in the chapter.</p>

              Meet your new friend, the dynamite bundle! </span>

            </div>
            <div class="linediv"></div> 
            <p> Every fight feels like a little puzzle with multiple ways to solve it, from going guns blazing to abuse the unique weakness of every enemy. This becomes way more important in the hardest difficulty where every weapon has its moment to shine.    
            <br> Here's an example: the secondary attack of the dynamite makes you detonate it after a short delay; this is useful for checking out rooms before entering guns blazing.</p>

                  One of the best feeling you can get: a room full of cultist and a loaded shotgun ready to blast some holes. </span>

              </div>
              <div class="linediv"></div> 
              <p> The main chapters feels very diverse one to the another in both terms of enemy variety, ammo count and backgrounds.
            Caleb goes in the first chapter from his grave to a chapel then he finds himself in a train station fighting his way to the last train. After delibertly derailing it he visits a Luna Park and in the end he reaches the boss: a giant Stone Gargoyle related to her lover Ophelia. </p>
            <p>In the other 3 chapters Caleb visits the artics, an hotel, a french town destroyed by airstrike, Cerberus lair and in the final chapter Tchnernobog's Lair.
            The final boss has a small "boss rush" part where you will fight the bosses of the precedent chapters: Cheog, Cerberus and Shial (a giant spider monster).</p>

                      Welcome to Cheog's Lair! <br> You will already know how to deal with him: a couple of rounds from the Napalm Launcher should do the trick.</span>

                  <div class="linediv"></div> 
                  <p>The two expansions feel very different from the main game: while Plasma Pak was built in house by Monolith, Cryptic Passage was not. </p>
            <p>I really didn't like Cryptic Passage: while it had huge environments to explore, it felt really empty and boring, without that distinct feel of actually doing something than just finding keys and blowing up cultists.
            The final boss was just terrible, a quick rip off by picking the Cerberus boss in chapter 3 and doubling it in a very small area. Overall the chapter feels a bit lackluster.</p>

                        Here I just fought a couple of zombies. So much free space wasted... </span>

                  <div class="linediv"></div> 
                  <p>Plasma Pak felt like a palette cleanser after Cryptic Passage: it picks up after the end of the main game and introduces new alt-fires for some weapons such as the Napalm Launcher and new type of enemies like the Mini Calebs .</p>
                  <p>The first level jumps ahead in the fray by placing you in front of a store with cultist on the roof and zombies running at you,: on Well Done you will be moving pretty fast to avoid everything.</p>
                  <p>In the next levels Caleb goes from a shopping district to a open air storage, then a giant temple. I really loved the secret level of this episode called Forgotten Catacombs, it's an underground crypt full to the brim of cultists: while the design is pretty simplicist it feels amazing spamming the Napalm Launcher in some tight corridors.</p>

                        Those small clones are perky bastards, if you've got a spare dynamite blow 'em up for good.  </span>

                    </div>     
                     
                    <p>The boss fight of this chapter its amazing! Three cultist that once received enough damage they trasform into the real boss called The Beauty and the Beasts. They pack a punch, so keep your distance. </p>
                      
            <p> It was really fun to do all the achievements, in the end I took a total of 30hrs to finish it 100% on the hardest difficulty. It's a difficult game but it never feels unfair, it requires you to master some mechanics such as fast movement, crouching, and learning the IA of every monster. <br> Since there are no checkpoints, you can always quicksave and quickload until you learn every ambush of the current level.</p>
