      <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Monolith Productions - 1997 - PC</strong></p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Nightdive Studios - 2019 - PC</strong></p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> <i>I live, again...</i> How fitting for
        this re-release of one of the "holy trinity" of games made with Build
        Engine: Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior and Blood.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Running on the KEX Engine by the talented
        developer Samuel Villarreal the game shines with a 60fps constant
        framerate and DX11 / OpenGL and even a Vulkan renderer. The
        only downside about the DX render is that you cannot use the
        overlay or take screenshots unless you run the game in windowed or
        borderless mode. Not a huge deal but still annoying.</p>

      <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I admit
          I spent quite some times looking at all those amazing rooms rendered
          in DX11.<br>
        </span></div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> The plot is barebone like every other fps
        before the arrival of the two colossus that began the narrative shooter
        genre: Half-Life &amp; Unreal. <br>
        The story begins with the protagonist and cultist Caleb getting killed
        with his friends by the dark god T'chernobog. After he discovers to be
        still alive, Caleb decides to get revenge by mass murdering <i>
          everything he sees </i>. Talk about having a wicked sense of justice.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p style="text-align: left;"> The game is divided into 4 chapters plus two
        expansions called <i> Plasma Pak </i> and <i> Cryptic Passage </i>
        which are both selectable from the main menu. <br>
        The first chapter is arguably the most difficult one: you will learn how
        to chuck barrels of dynamite (which takes a bit of time), to use ammo
        properly, since you will experience shortages in the first levels. <br>
        <br>
        Every fight feels like a little puzzle with multiple ways to solve it,
        from going guns blazing to abuse the unique weakness of every enemy. <br>
      </p>

      </div>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">One of
          the best feeling you can get: a room full of cultist and a loaded
          shotgun ready to blast some holes.<br>
        </span></div>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> The main chapters feels very diverse one
        to the another in both terms of enemy variety, ammo count and
        backgrounds. <br>
        Caleb goes in the first chapter from his grave to a chapel then he finds
        himself in a train station fighting his way to the last train. After
        delibertly derailing it he visits a Luna Park and in the end he reaches
        the boss: a giant Stone Gargoyle related to her lover Ophelia. <br>
        <br>
        The two expansions feel very different from the main game: while Plasma
        Pak was built <i> in house </i> by Monolith, <i> Cryptic Passage </i>
        was not. <br>
        I really didn't like Cryptic Passage: while it had huge environments to
        explore, it felt really empty and boring, without that distinct feel of
        actually doing something than just finding keys and blowing up cultists.
        <br>
        The final boss was just terrible, a quick rip off by picking the
        Cerberus boss in chapter 3 and doubling it in a very small area. Just a
        bad design overall. <br>
        <br>
        Plasma Pak felt like a palette cleanser after Cryptic Passage: it picks
        up after the end of the main game and introduces new alt-fires for some
        weapons such as the Napalm Launcher and new type of enemies like the <i>
          Mini Calebs </i>. <br>
        The boss fight was just amazing! Three cultist that once received enough
        damage they trasform into the real boss called <i>The Beauty and the
          Beasts.</i> <br>
        <br>
        It was really fun to do all the achievements, in the end I took a total
        of 30hrs to finish it 100% on the Well Done difficulty, which is hard as
        nails. <br>
        <br>
        <i> Really, really recommended to pick up for dirt cheap on a Steam
          discount, definitely worth the price. </i> <b> 9/10 </b>
