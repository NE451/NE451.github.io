    <h1>Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</h1>

      <div class="linediv"></div>
    <p>So.. this is my first jump to HTML and maybe a big upgrade for my small hobby of reviewing games.</p>
    <p>Eternal Darkness. What an amazing game by a talented team that got really unlucky since this game was planned to be on the N64, then on GameCube where finally was released.
        The delays were definitely worth, the atmosphere is curated and it really nailed the H.P Lovecraft settings. </p>
        <div class="linediv"></div>
<p>I really liked the plot, spanning a total of 10 characters including the villain that plays a major role in the first chapter by "deciding" which god he offers his sacrifices. There are a total of 4 gods:</p>


<ul class="a">
    <li>Ulyaoth.</li>
    <li>Xel'lotath.</li>
    <li>Chattur'gha.</li>
    <li>Chattur'gha.</li>
</ul>
    
<p>This gods are based on a rock, paper, scissors system that feels really rewarding.  Mantorok is hidden in a chapter and is "limitated" to some spells, but man those are the most powerful in some cases such as the shield spell or the summon Horror. <br>
    Every time you cast a spell you have to stand still and wait a certain amount of time, this wait really ramps up when you get the most advanced "circles of power" such as the pentagon or the septagon.</p>

    The summon system. <br>
    You can discover spells by finding them (every chapter has one) <br> or by trying new combinations. </span> </div> 
  </div>
  <div class="linediv"></div>
  <p>The gameplay is the classic survival horror that everyone loved in that period, SK definitely understood how to make a polished product. <br>
    The camera is mostly static with 3D backgrounds that are rendered in time, with sporadic moments where a dyamic camera shows the hard work done on making smooth turns.</p>

<p>Every character has different stats based on stamina, health, magick and sanity. The sanity system made this game iconic, when it's running low (by seeing monsters) you will start to see odd things such as blue screens, getting decapitated when casting spells or thinking you crossed several rooms just to get "teleported" back. You can undo those effects by casting magic spells or with some items such as unique items that some character carry.</p>

    <div class="linediv"></div>
<p>The cutscenes are rendered in real time and for a 2002 title I feel they're pretty good compared to most of those games that still used FMVs such as Fatal Frame.</p>

<p>The acting is nothing stellar but it gets the job done, and I think this is really important for a game that heavily focuses on the plot.</p>

<p>Now the only part I didn't like: the guardian of the artifact in the WW1 chapter. This boss feels impossible and frustrating until you understand that you just have to nail the timing down, then becomes a cakewalk. I think it could get a bit more polish since it's a really cool fight, but take this as a nitpick more than else.</p>

<p> Disclaimer: I played it on Dolphin and apart from some stutters it ran smoothly on constant 60fps. <br> In the end I really recomend this game, perfect for a couple of Spooktober nights!  </p>
